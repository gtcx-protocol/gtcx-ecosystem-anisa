# ANISA Cultural Data Requirements & Training Framework

**Critical Analysis: What Cultural Intelligence Actually Needs**

---

## üö® **Current Implementation Gap**

### **What ANISA Currently Has**
- **Basic keyword matching** for cultural markers
- **Hardcoded cultural insights** (4-5 generic statements per variant)
- **Simple region detection** based on country names
- **Static cultural compliance factors**
- **No real cultural training data**

### **What ANISA Actually Needs**
- **Deep cultural understanding** from authentic sources
- **Contextual cultural knowledge** for specific trade scenarios
- **Community-validated cultural practices** from real stakeholders
- **Dynamic cultural adaptation** based on local context
- **Continuous cultural learning** from community feedback

## üåü **The Cultural Intelligence Promise**

**ANISA's cultural intelligence must be built on:**

1. **Authentic Community Knowledge** - Real cultural practices from actual communities
2. **Traditional Authority Validation** - Approval from legitimate cultural authorities
3. **Academic Rigor** - Validated by cultural anthropology research
4. **Continuous Learning** - Ongoing adaptation based on community feedback
5. **Cultural Sovereignty** - Respect for cultural autonomy and self-determination

**ANISA cannot provide authentic cultural intelligence without this foundation of real cultural knowledge, community validation, and continuous learning from actual cultural practices.**
