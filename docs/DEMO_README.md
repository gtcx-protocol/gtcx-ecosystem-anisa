- **Region**: Geographic cultural area (e.g., West Africa, South Asia)
- **Variant**: Specific cultural approach (e.g., Ubuntu, Jugaad)
- **Meaning**: Philosophical foundation of the approach

### Response Analysis
- **Authenticity Score**: How well the response aligns with the cultural variant (0-100%)
- **Cultural Markers**: Keywords and phrases that indicate cultural context
- **Response Time**: Processing speed of the system

### Performance Metrics
- **Total Queries**: Number of questions processed
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successful responses
- **Average Response Time**: Mean processing time

## 🎯 Tips for Best Experience

1. **Start with the Interactive Demo** to understand all features
2. **Try different types of questions** to see cultural detection in action
3. **Notice how responses vary** based on detected cultural context
4. **Use the web demo** for visual presentations
5. **Explore the API** if you're a developer

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Import errors**: Make sure you're in the correct directory and virtual environment is activated
- **API not starting**: Check if port 8000 is available, or modify the port in `start_api.py`
