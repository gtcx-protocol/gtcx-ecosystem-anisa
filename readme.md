- **Respects Local Traditions** - Integrates cultural practices into compliance and verification
- **Preserves Sovereignty** - Ensures countries maintain cultural control over trade operations
- **Enables Cross-Cultural Trade** - Bridges cultural divides for seamless international commerce
- **Supports Community Validation** - Engages local stakeholders in verification processes
- **Enhances GTCX Components** - Provides cultural intelligence to PANX, GCI, AGI, and more

## 🛠️ **Getting Started**

### **Quick Start**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/gtcx-protocol-ecosystem/gtcx-ecosystem-anisa.git
cd gtcx-ecosystem-anisa

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the GTCX Trade Demo
python3 demos/gtcx_trade_demo.py

# Start the API server
python3 scripts/start_api.py
```

### **Basic Usage**

```python
from src.core import ANISACore
from src.models import GTCTradeQuery, GTCTradePhase, CulturalRegion

# Initialize ANISA
anisa = ANISACore()

# Create a GTCX trade query
trade_query = GTCTradeQuery(
    query_text="How can we ensure our gold mining operations meet both regulatory compliance and community expectations?",
    trade_phase=GTCTradePhase.COMPLIANCE_ASSESSMENT,
    commodity_type="gold",
    source_region=CulturalRegion.WEST_AFRICA,
    destination_region=CulturalRegion.NORTH_AMERICA,
    # ... other parameters
)

# Process with cultural intelligence
response = await anisa.process_gtcx_trade_query(trade_query)
print(f"Cultural Authenticity: {response.cultural_authentication.confidence_score}")
```

### **Training Quick Start**

- Install training deps: `pip install -r requirements-training.txt`
- One-command run: `bash scripts/quick_train.sh`
- Artifacts: `./models/anisa-quick-start`, data at `training_data/raw/`
- Baseline accuracy is low from minimal seed data; add more in `src/training/data/data_collector.py`
